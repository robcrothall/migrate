His role was to streamline and simplify the use of their AS systems, and implement any enhancements that were requested by the users.   What was previously an extremely  difficult, labour intensive and time consuming system, which took about one week to accomplish has been streamlined to take a few hours in an unattended (disconnected)  mode.   This means that a few hours after the month end "copy management" files become available for processing, all the reports have been run and submitted for printing.

This would benefit the personnel in the Human Resources department, as it would give them more time to handle the heavier work load at year end.  All the reports required at Tax Year end would be available much sooner, which would benefit both the Human Resources department and many other departments within Nedcor who are reliant on getting information and reports from the Human Resources deparment at this busy time of the year.

This would have a double benefit by reducing the disk space requirements and the number of files that would have to be converted during the VM to MVS migration.

This would result in even greater benefits to those described above, as  many people and departments throughout Nedcor are dependant on the rapid production of Year End reports and graphs.

It would also mean that the testing and parallel running required for the move from VM to MVS would happen after the extremely busy Year End processing has been completed, and thus not put any additional load on the users during their busiest period of the year.

  To install into OS/2, create a program object.

  For FILE, use PMREXX.EXE.  OS/2 will use PM as type of session.
  For parameters, use the FINDFILE.CMD, specifying the path where
  you placed it:   c:\$REXX\FINDFILE   for example.

  For working directory, specify any directory or leave blank.

  To invoke the PMREXX, double-click on the program object and
  respond to the PMREXX prompt.  If you reply with a question mark,
  the REXX will display syntax of the response.

  This REXX file supplements the existing OS/2 2.0 features and
  also presents a good sample REXX showing several important things.
